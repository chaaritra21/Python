Q1.You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)

Q2.Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird

n = int(input())
if n%2 != 0 :
    print("Weird")
elif n%2==0 and 2<=n<=5 :
    print("Not Weird")
elif n%2==0 and 6<=n<=20 :
    print("Weird")
elif n%2==0 and n>20 :
    print("Not Weird")
else :
    print("Not in the list")

Q3.The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)


Q4The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .

a = int(input())
b = float(input())
print(a//b)
print(a/b)

Q5.An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Sol-
def is_leap(year):
    if year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    if year % 100 == 0:
        return False
    if year % 4 == 0:
        return True
    else:
   return False
